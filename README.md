                                     THE PIZZA TASK  
1. Task description  
    - Let’s imagine you want to start a new pizza delivery business. Please create a small web application for online pizza ordering. The idea is to make a non-existing service where assumed clients can choose a pizza, put it into a cart and make an order. 
2. Requirements  
    - The menu page should contain at least 8 pizzas 
    - Login is not required but could be available for checking the history of orders  
    - Your clients should be able to choose pizzas directly from the menu 
    - You can decide what else you want in the menu  
    - Adding a description for each pizza would be a nice decision 
    - Don’t proceed to the payment page. The last action from a client will be filling in the order form (address, 
name, surname, etc.) to get a confirmation that the order has been received 
    - A client should be able to put several pizzas into cart, and the quantity must be defined both while 
outside the cart and in the cart 
    - Total price of each order must be calculated and shown in euros and in dollars  
    - Don’t forget to add delivery costs to the final bill 
3. Technologies 
    - You are free to use any frameworks or libraries, but keep in mind that we primarily evaluate interface, 
functionality and workflow 
    - Less is more 
4. Delivery format  
    - Please provide a link to your repository and a direct link to the deployed version of your application (e.g. 
on Heroku) 
    - The solution must be testable by a non-technical person  
5. Resources  
    - Deployment of the application: Heroku  
    - Free mysql db host (https://remotemysql.com/) 
    - Use Git as code source management tool (following Git Flow will be assessed) 
    - The estimated duration for the task completion is 7 days
